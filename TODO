- Try to speed up SVT_SparseArray transposition by implementing a one-pass
  approach that uses ExtendableJaggedArray intermediate buffers (offss, valss).
  See src/readSparseCSV.c where this approach is already used.
  Note that this will require that ExtendableJaggedArray structs are able
  to support other types of columns (only support int at the moment).

- Implement C_subassign_SVT_with_Rarray() and C_subassign_SVT_with_SVT().

- Implement table() method for SVT_SparseArray objects of type logical,
  integer, or raw (should it go in R/SparseArray-summarize.R?)

- Implement matrixStats methods for SVT_SparseMatrix objects.

- Implement Ops methods (Arith, Compare, Logic) for SVT_SparseArray objects.

- Implement Math2 methods and **some** Math methods (only those that
  preserve sparsity that is: abs, sign, sqrt, ceiling, floor, trunc, log1p,
  asin, asinh, atan, atanh, expm1, sin, sinh, sinpi, tan, tanh, and tanpi).

- Implement crossprod(), tcrossprod(), and %*%, for SVT_SparseMatrix objects.

- Add unit tests for the SVT_SparseArray stuff.

- Implement function for loading a TENxMatrixSeed subset as an
  SVT_SparseMatrix. Test it on the 1.3 Million Brain Cell Dataset.

- Go after dgCMatrix objects in ExperimentHub (query(eh, "dgCMatrix")),
  convert them to SVT_SparseMatrix objects and try to do the things that
  are usually done on them.

- Convert 8322787x1098 dgTMatrix (ExperimentHub resource EH5453) to
  SVT_SparseMatrix and try to do the things that the curatedMetagenomicData
  folks usually do on it.
