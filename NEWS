VERSION 1.4.0
-------------

NEW FEATURES

    o The following operation are now multithreaded (via OpenMP):
        - SparseMatrix multiplication and crossprod()
        - the matrixStats methods for SparseMatrix objects
      See ?set_SparseArray_nthread for more information.

    o Define some of the basic coercion methods that used to be defined in
      the Matrix package but that the lazy Matrix maintainers have decided
      to deprecate in Matrix 1.7-0 (e.g. coercion from matrix to dgRMatrix).

BUG FIXES

    o Fix aperm(<SVT_SparseArray>) when inner dimensions are not permuted
      See https://github.com/Bioconductor/SparseArray/issues/6

    o Fix long-standing bug in C function _dotprod_leaf_vector_and_double_col().
      In some circumstances the function was reading beyond a C array.
      Observed effects varied from no observed effects (on Linux) to breaking
      crossprod() unit tests on arm64 Mac (consistently), on Windows
      (sporadically), and also probably on PowerPC (or possibly a crash
      sometimes on this platform.

VERSION 1.2.0
-------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Add aperm() method for SVT_SparseArray objects.

    o Add abind() method for SparseArray objects.

    o Add dim() setter for SVT_SparseArray objects.

    o Introduce nzwhich() generic and method for SparseArray derivatives.
      Also provide a default method for ordinary arrays and other array-like
      objects.

    o Implement 'Logic' ops on SVT_SparseArray objects.

    o Implement 'Math'/'Math2' ops on SVT_SparseArray objects of type "double".

    o 'Compare' ops now support SVT_SparseArray objects of type() "raw"
      or "complex".

    o All matrixStats methods (except row/colMedians()) now work on
      multidimensional SVT_SparseArray objects and support the 'dims'
      argument, like the row/colSums() and row/colMeans() functions in base R.

    o Add row/colAnys() + row/colAlls() + row/colAnyNAs() + row/colProds()
      methods for SVT_SparseArray objects.

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o Rename nzvals() slot getter (for COO_SparseArray objects) -> nzdata().
      Also reintroduce nzvals() as a fast way to get 'x[nzwhich(x)]' on a
      sparse array-like object 'x'.

    o Re-implement all matrixStats methods (except row/colMedians()) for
      SVT_SparseArray objects in C.


VERSION 1.0.0
-------------

    o First version of the package that is ready for general use.
